EEG-Notebooks - Democratizing the cognitive neuroscience experiment
===================================================================

EEG notebooks is a collection of classic EEG experiments, implemented in Python and Jupyter notebooks. The experimental protocols and analyses are quite generic, but are primarily taylored for low-budget / consumer EEG hardware such as the MUSE. The goal is to make cognitive neuroscience and neurotechnology more accessible, affordable, and scalable.

Acknowledgments
----------------


EEG-Notebooks was created by the `NeurotechX <https://neurotechx.com/>`_ hacker/developer/neuroscience community. The ininitial idea and majority of the groundwork was due to Alexandre Barachant - including the `muse-lsl <https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl/>`_ library, which is core dependency. Lead developer on the project is now `John Griffiths <www.grifflab.com>`_ .
