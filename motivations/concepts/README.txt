Concepts
--------

This section seeks to motivate the idea of conceptualizing neural data as being comprised of both periodic and aperiodic activity.

In particular, these examples investigate how the notion of different components in neural data relates to practices in digital signal processing, and why this motivates approaches such as parameterizing neural power spectra.
