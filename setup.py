FOOOF: Fitting Oscillations & One-Over F

FOOOF is a fast, efficient, physiologically-informed model to parameterize neural
power spectra, characterizing both the aperiodic & periodic components.

The model conceives of the neural power spectrum as consisting of two distinct components:

1) an aperiodic component, reflecting 1/f like characteristics, modeled with an exponential fit, with
2) band-limited peaks, reflecting putative oscillations, and modeled as Gaussians

The module includes:

- Code for applying models to parameterize neural power spectra
- Plotting functions for visualizing power spectra, model fits, and model parameters
- Analysis functions for examining model components and parameters
- Utilities for Input/Output management, data management and analysis reports
- Simulation code for simulating power spectra for methods testing

More details are available on the documentation site.
